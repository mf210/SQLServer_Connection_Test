# SQL Server Connection Test

This Python script utilizes PyODBC to test SQL Server connections. It's designed to help you verify the connectivity of your SQL Server database. Use this tool to ensure smooth integration between your Python application and SQL Server.

## Prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (3.x recommended)
- [PyODBC](https://pypi.org/project/pyodbc/) - Install using [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)

  ```bash
  pipenv install pyodbc
  ```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/SQLServer_Connection_Test.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd SQLServer_Connection_Test
   ```

3. Install dependencies using Pipenv:

   ```bash
   pipenv install
   ```

4. Update the connection details in the script:

   ```python
   server = 'your_server_ip'
   port = 'your_server_port'
   database = 'your_database_name'
   username = 'your_username'
   password = 'your_password'
   ```

5. Run the script:

   ```bash
   pipenv run python your_script_name.py
   ```

## Configuration

Adjust the connection string in the script based on your SQL Server setup. Ensure the necessary drivers are installed on your system.
